Example: Account Id Populate From Mirror.

uv run examples/account/account_id_populate_from_mirror.py
python examples/account/account_id_populate_from_mirror.py

This example demonstrates how to populate AccountId fields
using mirror node lookups:

1. Create an AccountId from an EVM address
2. Trigger auto account creation via HBAR transfer
3. Populate account number (num) from mirror node
4. Populate EVM address from mirror node
