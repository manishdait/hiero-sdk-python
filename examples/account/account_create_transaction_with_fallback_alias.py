"""

Example: Create an account where the EVM alias is derived from the main ECDSA key.

This demonstrates:
- Passing only an ECDSA PrivateKey to `set_key_with_alias`
- The alias being derived from the main key's EVM address (fallback behaviour)

Usage:
    uv run examples/account/account_create_transaction_with_fallback_alias.py
    python examples/account/account_create_transaction_with_fallback_alias.py
