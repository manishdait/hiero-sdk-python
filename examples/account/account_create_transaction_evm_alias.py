Example: Create an account using an EVM-style alias (evm_address).

This example demonstrates:
1. Generating an ECDSA key pair (required for EVM compatibility).
2. Deriving the EVM address from the public key.
3. Creating a new Hedera account with that EVM address as its alias.
4. Retrieving the account info to verify the alias.

Usage:
    uv run examples/account/account_create_transaction_evm_alias.py
