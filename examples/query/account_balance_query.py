Query Balance Example.

This script demonstrates how to:
1. Set up a client connection to the Hedera network
2. Create a new account with an initial balance
3. Query account balance
4. Transfer HBAR between accounts

Run with:
  uv run examples/query/account_balance_query.py
  python examples/query/account_balance_query.py
