"""
Account Creation Example.

This module demonstrates how to create a new Hedera account using the Hiero Python SDK.
It shows the complete workflow from setting up a client with operator credentials
to creating a new account and handling the transaction response.

The example creates an account with:
- A generated Ed25519 key pair
- An initial balance of 1 HBAR (100,000,000 tinybars)
- A custom account memo

Usage:
    Run this script directly:
        python examples/account_create.py
    
    Or using uv:
        uv run examples/account_create.py

Requirements:
    - Environment variables OPERATOR_ID and OPERATOR_KEY must be set
    - A .env file with the operator credentials (recommended)
    - Sufficient HBAR balance in the operator account to pay for account creation

    Create a new Hedera account with generated keys and initial balance.
    
    This function generates a new Ed25519 key pair, creates an account creation
    transaction, signs it with the operator key, and executes it on the network.
    The new account is created with an initial balance and a custom memo.
    
    Args:
        client (Client): Configured Hedera client instance for network communication
        operator_key (PrivateKey): The operator's private key for signing the transaction
    
    Returns:
        None: This function doesn't return a value but prints the results
    
    Raises:
        Exception: If the transaction fails or the account ID is not found in the receipt
        SystemExit: Calls sys.exit(1) if account creation fails
    
    Side Effects:
        - Prints transaction status and account details to stdout
        - Creates a new account on the Hedera network
        - Deducts transaction fees from the operator account
        - Exits the program with code 1 if creation fails
