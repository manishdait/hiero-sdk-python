# Release Process for the Hiero Python SDK

This document describes how we handle versioning and publishing new releases of the Hiero Python SDK.

## Semantic Versioning

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) for this project:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: Backward-compatible new features
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes and other minor changes

## Release Steps

1. **Update the Version**
   Decide whether the changes are major, minor, or patch increments.

2. **Run Tests**
   - Ensure all tests pass locally (run `pytest`).
   - Confirm CI passes (integration tests, etc.).

3. **Tag the Release**
   Once the release changes are merged, create and push a git tag that matches the publish workflow trigger (`v*.*.*`):

   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.2.0 -m "Release 0.2.0"
   git push origin v0.2.0
   ```

4. **Monitor the Publish Workflow**
   - The `.github/workflows/publish.yml` workflow runs automatically when the tag is pushed.
   - The workflow builds the source distribution and wheel, generates protobufs before packaging, signs the release artifacts with Sigstore, publishes the package to PyPI, and creates or updates the GitHub release.

5. **Verify Published Artifacts**
   - Confirm the new version is available on PyPI.
   - Confirm the GitHub release contains the wheel, source distribution, and matching `.sigstore.json` bundles.
   - If release provenance needs to be audited, use the Sigstore verification materials attached to the GitHub release.
