# Advanced Issue Guidelines — Hiero Python SDK

## How to Use This Document

This guide is here to support maintainers and issue creators who use the **Advanced** label
in the Hiero Python SDK repository.

It offers shared language and examples to help:

**Issue creators:**
- Describe larger, more complex tasks clearly
- Set expectations around scope, impact, and collaboration
- Provide helpful context for experienced contributors

**Maintainers:**
- Apply the Advanced label consistently
- Keep issue difficulty labels clear and useful

This isn’t a rulebook, and it’s not meant to limit what kinds of contributions are welcome.
All contributions — from small fixes to major improvements — are valuable to the Hiero project.

The **Advanced** label simply highlights work that involves deeper design, broader impact,
and long-term ownership.

---

## Purpose

Advanced Issues represent **high-impact, high-responsibility work**.

They’re a great fit for contributors who:

- Have deep familiarity with the Python SDK
- Enjoy designing solutions and evaluating trade-offs
- Are comfortable thinking about long-term impact

These issues often involve shaping how the SDK evolves over time.

---

## What to Expect

Advanced Issues are designed for contributors who:

- Have strong Python SDK and domain knowledge
- Understand performance, concurrency, and API stability considerations
- Feel comfortable proposing and discussing designs
- Are open to conversations about breaking changes and long-term direction

These issues usually involve more discussion, iteration, and collaboration than earlier issue levels.

---

## How Advanced Issues Usually Feel

Advanced Issues often:

- Are design-heavy
- Affect multiple parts of the SDK
- Have long-term maintenance impact
- Involve discussion, iteration, and review

They’re a great fit for contributors who enjoy tackling complex problems and shaping the future of the project.

## Common Types of Advanced Work

Here are some examples of tasks that often fit well at this level:

### Core SDK Changes
- Significant behavior changes with clear motivation
- Refactors spanning multiple related subsystems
- Improvements to core execution paths or abstractions
- Bug fixes that require investigation across multiple layers

### Architecture & Design
- Introducing new abstractions or subsystems
- Improving extensibility or testability through redesign
- Decoupling tightly coupled components
- Addressing systemic architectural issues

### Interfaces & Contracts
- Evolving public or internal APIs with clear rationale
- Formalizing or refining existing contracts
- Improving type consistency across large areas of the codebase
- Introducing shared types or protocols

### Documentation & Guidance
- Writing or updating architectural documentation
- Explaining non-obvious design decisions
- Adding migration notes or deprecation guidance
- Aligning docs with new behavior or APIs

### Examples & Developer Experience
- Designing new examples for advanced features
- Updating examples to reflect new APIs or workflows
- Improving clarity around advanced usage patterns

### Testing & Validation
- Designing new test strategies
- Adding comprehensive coverage for new abstractions
- Refactoring test architecture to support new designs
- Introducing regression tests for complex scenarios

## What Advanced Issues Are *Not*

Advanced Issues are not just “bigger versions” of other issue types.

If a task:

- Can be completed by following existing patterns
- Is mostly mechanical or scripted
- Has very limited impact or risk

…it may be a better fit for **Beginner** or **Intermediate** labels.

Advanced Issues usually involve:

- Design choices
- Trade-offs
- Broader context
- Long-term considerations

---

## Typical Scope & Time

Advanced Issues are usually:

- ⏱ **Estimated time:** 3+ days
- 📄 **Scope:** Multiple modules or repository-wide
- 🧠 **Challenge level:** Design, iteration, and long-term ownership

They often evolve through discussion and may require multiple review cycles.

## Example: A Well-Formed Advanced Issue

### Implement HIP-1261 fee estimate query support in the Python SDK

The Hiero Python SDK doesn’t currently support fee estimate queries as defined in
HIP-1261. This makes it harder for developers to programmatically estimate
transaction fees before execution.

This issue focuses on **designing and implementing full SDK support** for HIP-1261, including:

- Public APIs
- Internal request/response handling
- Tests and examples

The implementation should align with the HIP specification and stay consistent
with patterns used across other SDKs.

**Reference design document:**
https://github.com/hiero-ledger/sdk-collaboration-hub/blob/main/proposals/hips/hip-1261.md

### Suggested Steps

1. Review HIP-1261 to understand the intended behavior and constraints
2. Design the Python SDK API surface for fee estimate queries
3. Implement the feature across the SDK, including:
   - Public-facing query or transaction classes
   - Internal request/response handling
   - Validation and error handling
4. Add unit and integration tests
5. Provide at least one usage example

---

## Support & Collaboration

Advanced Issues are supported through:

- Design discussions in issues and PRs
- Maintainer and community feedback
- Iterative review cycles

Support focuses on:

- Exploring design options
- Evaluating trade-offs
- Ensuring long-term maintainability

The goal is to build strong, well-considered solutions together.

---

## Maintainer Guidance

An issue is often a good fit for the **Advanced** label when it:

- Involves system-level thinking
- Has long-term impact on the SDK
- Benefits from experienced review and iteration

---

Advanced Issues are about shaping the future of the project —
through thoughtful design, collaboration, and long-term vision.
